OverECS

This is a remake of my ECS system I've been building internally for a few years.

This is not a good example of code design or anything else, but rather an efficient ECS design that I've been using for years.

Currently in are Entities, Component tables, and Aspects, though all are a little bit neutered, may be fleshed out over time.

Currently not done is the generic Event system, helpers to make defining the components less painful, and a bit more.
